## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Search Algorithms
[Project 1](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/csci446-a1.git) uses breadth/depth first searches, greedy algorithm, and A-star to ultimately solve puzzles, in this case, randomly generated mazes of different sizes. 
This involves structuring the maze such that it can be represented as a graph and or tree.


### Project 2: Constraint Satisfaction Problems
[Project 2](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/csci446-a2.git) focuses on CSP, a manner in which the agent must satisfy constaints using heuristics. In this case, a common phone game is implemented but rather a user solving the maze, the agent solves it. The constraints are used to tether the agent in which it will actually solve the maze. This is implemented as a decision tree such that the contraints eliminate possible options.


### Project 3: First-Order Logic
[Project 3](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/csci446-a3.git) uses reinforcement learning with the application of first-order logic. The program is known as "Wumpus World" where an agent is to perform a task while avoiding obstacles using the first order logic. The overall idea is that the agent makes a decision with respect to its current state in training. Once the training is complete, a pruning process is used to eliminate decisions in which the agent would not receive a reward.
