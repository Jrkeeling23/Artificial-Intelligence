## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Search Algorithms
[Project 1](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/csci446-a1.git) uses breadth/depth first searches, greedy algorithm, and A-star to ultimately solve puzzles, in this case, randomly generated mazes of different sizes. 
This involves structuring the maze such that it can be represented as a graph and or tree.


### Project 2: Constraint Satisfaction Problems
[Project 2](https://github.com/Jrkeeling23/csci446-a2.git) focuses on CSP, a manner in which the agent must satisfy constaints using heuristics. In this case a common phone game is implemented but rather the user solving the maze, the agent solves the game. Using more constraints to the problem allowed the agent to solve the game in less steps.


### Project 3: First Order Logic
